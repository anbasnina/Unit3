A dynamic runner with endless side scrolling, in which the player needs to jump over oncoming obstacles in time to avoid accidents. 

While creating this prototype, I learned how to add music and sound effects, completely changing the experience of past projects, as well as how to create dynamic endless repeating backgrounds that are crucial for any side-scrolling games, use particle effects such as bursts and explosions that make games much more enjoyable.
